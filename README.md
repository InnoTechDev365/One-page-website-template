# One-page-website-templateJSON template for creating a one-page website â€” resume of a text specialist.  
To work with the template, you will need: CMS WordPress, the free version of the Elementor plugin, and the Hello Elementor theme.  
Brief instructions for setting up the template:  
Create a blank page for Elementor and set its layout to full width. Then, through the WordPress admin panel in the Elementor â†’ Templates tab, import the downloaded template. Return to the page in Elementor and, choosing "Insert Template from Library," insert our template.  
All images for the template are inserted not using a widget, but through programming code, which will allow you to more flexibly configure the display of images by specifying only the link to the image source in the HTML code fragment. This approach will significantly reduce the server load and speed up the operation of your future website.
