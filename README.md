JSON template for creating a one-page website â€” a resume for a text specialist.  
To work with the template, you will need: CMS WordPress, the free version of the Elementor plugin, and the Hello Elementor theme.  
Brief instructions for setting up the template:  
Create a blank page for Elementor and set its layout to full width. Then, through the WordPress admin panel, go to the Elementor â†’ Templates tab and import the uploaded template. Return to the page in Elementor and, selecting "Insert template from library," insert our template.  
All images for the template are inserted not using a widget but through the coding, which will allow you to customize the display of images more flexibly by specifying only the link to the image source in the HTML code fragment. This approach will significantly reduce the load on the server and speed up the performance of your future website.

After downloading the template, you will receive a zip archive that must be unpacked, and in WordPress, you should import only one file from the template â€” otherwise, the template will not be imported!
