# JSON template for creating a one-page website â€” resume of a text specialist.  
To work with the template, you will need: CMS WordPress, the free version of the Elementor plugin, and the Hello Elementor theme.  
Brief instructions for setting up the template:  
Create a blank page for Elementor and set its layout to full width. Then, through the WordPress admin panel in the Elementor â†’ Templates tab, import the downloaded template. Return to the page in Elementor and, choosing "Insert Template from Library," insert our template.  

All images for the template are inserted not using a widget, but through the program code, which will allow you to customize the display of images more flexibly by replacing only the link to the image source in the HTML code fragment. This approach will significantly reduce the load on the server and speed up the work of your future website.
